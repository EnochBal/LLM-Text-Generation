# LLM-Text-Generation
Using a LLM (OpenAI API) adjusting parameters  to generate text meeting the desired requirements.

This file contains a simple demonstration on how to import a LLM (Large Language Model), and manipulate parameters like 'model', 'prompt', and 'max_tokens' to generate text, e.g. a short story.
The model used in this example is gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct through OpenAI API using a paid Key.
To replicate this code, you'll need to use a valid OpenAI key.
The purpose of this project is to show users how to programatically interacting with OpenAIâ€™s models for text generation, summarization, and more.
