# LLM-Text-Generation
Using a LLM (OpenAI API) adjusting parameters  to generate text meeting the desired requirements.

This file contains a simple demonstration on how to import a LLM (Large Language Model), and manipulate parameters like 'model', 'prompt', and 'max_tokens' to generate text, e.g. a short story.
The model used in this example is gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct through OpenAI API using a paid Key.

    !pip install openai
    !pip install python-dotenv

2.- Make sure you have a valid OpenAI key with available tokens.
